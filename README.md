# Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression

This project leverages a **Linear Regression Model** to forecast house prices using machine learning techniques. By analyzing a comprehensive housing dataset, we aim to predict property values based on various influential features.

## Overview

The projectâ€™s objective is to create an accurate machine learning model using **Linear Regression** for house price prediction. We systematically explore, preprocess, and engineer features from the data to build and evaluate a robust model.

## Data at a Glance

The dataset comprises housing details essential for predicting prices. It includes:

- **Key Attributes**:
  - Property size
  - Number of bedrooms
  - Geographic location
  - House age
  - Other pertinent factors

## Project Workflow

### Step 1: Load the Data
We begin by importing the dataset and organizing it for analysis.

### Step 2: Explore the Data
Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we uncover data patterns, address missing values, and inspect the relationships among features.

### Step 3: Prepare the Data
Data preprocessing involves cleaning, handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and normalizing features to ensure readiness for modeling.

### Step 4: Engineer Features
We may derive new features from the existing data to strengthen the model's predictive capabilities.

### Step 5: Model Building
Using the processed data, we develop and train the Linear Regression model. The model's performance is then assessed using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
